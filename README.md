# Native Ruby extensions written in Crystal

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/phoffer/crystalized_ruby](https://badges.gitter.im/phoffer/crystalized_ruby.svg)](https://gitter.im/phoffer/crystalized_ruby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Functional code for native extensions, without using FFI. This can utilize any Crystal code, i.e. existing shards.

**This is still in heavy development and not ready for use.** If you are interested in creating a proof of concept, I'm happy to assist. But otherwise, this isn't ready for real use.

Current work is splitting this repo into multiple repos:

1. A Crystal shard that contains the Ruby bindings (will be this repo)
2. [A faster version of ActiveSupport::Inflector](https://github.com/phoffer/fast_inflector) that utilizes [inflector.cr](https://github.com/phoffer/inflector.cr) as a native extension
3. A Ruby gem that assists with generating a gem that uses Crystal for a native extension

This work is being done on the `repo-split` branch.

## Class conversion status

| Ruby class  | Ruby => Crystal | Crystal => Ruby |
| ----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| String      | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Symbol      | :x:                | :white_check_mark: |
| Integer     | :white_check_mark:* | :white_check_mark: |
| Float       | :x:                | :x:                |
| Hash        | :x:                | :white_check_mark: |
| Array       | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Regexp      | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Nil         | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| True        | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| False       | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |

# TODO

- [ ] get all types working
  + [ ] float rb <=> cr
  + [ ] negative integers rb => cr
  + [ ] hash rb => cr
  + [ ] something for symbol rb => cr
- [ ] be able to build gem and use (even just for checking type conversions)
- [ ] separate repo into crystal shard for lib_ruby related, generator gem, and fast_inflector gem

## Updates

See [updates.md](updates.md)

# Problems

* Negative integers don't convert correctly
* Floats aren't working
* I am having trouble with defining methods with various parameter counts. There's additional Crystal libs just for defining methods with zero or two parameters. This is obnoxious and the biggest annoyance I have right now, so I'd love to fix that soon.
* I can't get a proc as a C callback working. There's some broken code commented out. Would love assistance from someone more knowledgeable. Right now this is for converting a Ruby hash to a Crystal hash. 

# How to get this working

Minimum crystal version: 0.16.0

Make sure Crystal is installed (Homebrew on OSX is fine)

Test and benchmark scripts both require [fast_blank](https://github.com/SamSaffron/fast_blank) and [active_support](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport), mainly for comparison. Test script also uses [descriptive_statistics](https://github.com/thirtysixthspan/descriptive_statistics), and the benchmark script uses [benchmark-ips](https://github.com/evanphx/benchmark-ips). None of these are required, except to run those two Ruby scripts. There's a Gemfile to install them if desired.

```
rake clean
rake compile
rake test
bin/test
bin/benchmark
```

# Benchmarking

There is a benchmark script that compares a few things. The methods replicating ActiveSupport methods are copy-pasted, not even re-implemented from scratch. This uses the improved String#blank? method from AS 5.0, but it's not a hard requirement.

Some highlights (see results.txt for more):

```
Comparison:
        cr fibonacci:    22743.9 i/s
        rb fibonacci:      923.2 i/s - 24.63x slower

Comparison:
     empty string rb:  7591363.0 i/s
empty string crystal:  6973264.7 i/s - same-ish: difference falls within error

Comparison:
     CR blank string:  2393668.6 i/s
     AS blank string:   923967.3 i/s - 2.59x slower

Comparison:
           cr squish:   691693.1 i/s
           AS squish:   202554.1 i/s - 3.41x slower

Comparison:
          cr ordinal:  5044785.3 i/s
          AS ordinal:  1775271.7 i/s - 2.84x slower

Comparison:
       fast_blank rb:  6599201.8 i/s
       blank crystal:  2199386.4 i/s - 3.00x slower
```


# Thanks and influences

There's three main projects that I've gained knowledge from to get this fully working:

- [manastech/crystal_ruby](https://github.com/manastech/crystal_ruby)
- [notozeki/crystal_example_ext](https://gist.github.com/notozeki/7159a9d9ab9707a22129)
- [gaar4ica/ruby_ext_in_crystal_math](https://github.com/gaar4ica/ruby_ext_in_crystal_math)
- [Jason Carter, my very best friend](https://github.com/jasonwc)

These have all been incredibly helpful, and this is very closely modeled after the last two sources. @gaar4ica's also includes a PDF from a talk she gave at Fosdem, which was highly informative.

# Future Ideas + Contributing

I'd like to get this more fully fleshed out, more functional, and get it usable. There is some question as to whether or not writing a native Ruby extension in Crystal is a useful idea, and I'd love to learn more about both why it _would_ and would _not_ be worthwhile, from people out there who are far more knowledgeable than I am.

If anyone is interested in this concept, please reach out to me either on this repo or on Twitter (@phoffer8). I'd love to collaborate with anyone interested, and just learn more in general.

# Wish List

* Complete the LibRuby wrapper for ruby.h and possibly a way to automate extracting the signatures from ruby.h into Crystal
* Create a series of macros to create the wrappers of the Crystal methods (to convert input and output type between Crystal and CRuby)
* Separate the LibRuby part into a separate gem/shard to make it reusable
* If it was possible to create the aforementioned macros, then it would be great to create a generator to create the template of a Ruby gem with the native extension bits (libruby, extconf, makefile, etc)

Goal: to make it as easy as possible to create Ruby gems with Crystal-based native extensions where we could start with a "slow" Ruby source, tweak it quickly into a Crystal source file, wrap it up with LibRuby and compile it back as a native extension. No having to resort to C, Rust or other low level options.
